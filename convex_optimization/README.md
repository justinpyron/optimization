# convex_optimization

This directory contains code that implements a convex optimization solver *from scratch*.

The source code is located in `convex_functions.py` and `convex_problem.py`.

Usage of the solver is demonstrated in `convex_optimization.ipynb`.

The mathematical theory underpinning the solver is outlined in `convex_optimization_overview.pdf`.
