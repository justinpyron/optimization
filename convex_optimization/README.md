# convex_optimization

This directory contains code that implements a convex optimization solver *from scratch* using the logarithmic barrier method.

The source code is located in `convex_functions.py` and `convex_problem.py`.

Usage of the solver is demonstrated in `convex_optimization.ipynb`, and correctness is verified by comparing with an existing convex optimization package (`cvxpy`).

The mathematical theory underpinning the solver is outlined in `convex_optimization_overview.pdf`, in particular the final section on algorithms.
